DNS, or Domain Name System, works like an internet phonebook. 
When we type a website address, like www.buzzinite.com, into our browser.
DNS converts that address into an IP address, 
like 295.173/295.173, which is the computer-friendly address of the website.
This process happens quickly in the background, allowing us 
to reach the website without needing to remember complex numbers.
