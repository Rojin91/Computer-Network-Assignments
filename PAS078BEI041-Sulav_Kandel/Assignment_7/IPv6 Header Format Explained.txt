IPv6 Header Format Explained
Question 1: How long is an IPv6 header?
* An IPv6 header is 40 bytes (320 bits) long.
Question 2: What are the different fields in the header? The IPv6 header consists of the following fields:
1. Version (4 bits)
2. Traffic Class (8 bits)
3. Flow Label (20 bits)
4. Payload Length (16 bits)
5. Next Header (8 bits)
6. Hop Limit (8 bits)
7. Source Address (128 bits)
8. Destination Address (128 bits)


Question 3: What is the purpose of each header field?
1. Version (4 bits)
   * Indicates the IP version, which is 6 for IPv6.
2. Traffic Class (8 bits)
   * Used for QoS (Quality of Service) and priority settings.
3. Flow Label (20 bits)
   * Identifies traffic flows that require special handling.
4. Payload Length (16 bits)
   * Specifies the length of the payload (the data) in bytes following the header.
5. Next Header (8 bits)
   * Identifies the type of header immediately following the IPv6 header, often indicating the transport layer protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP).
6. Hop Limit (8 bits)
   * Specifies the maximum number of hops a packet can take before being discarded (similar to TTL in IPv4).
7. Source Address (128 bits)
   * The IPv6 address of the sender.
8. Destination Address (128 bits)
   * The IPv6 address of the intended recipient.
